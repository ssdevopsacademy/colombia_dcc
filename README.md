- C. Trunk-based development 

### 4. the difference between "Commit" and "Add" commands is:

- B. "Add" save all staged changes and "Commit" includes a change in the working directory
- C. "Commit" save all staged changes and "Add" only save one staged change

- D. A & C

### 10. Exists two Git Workflow used in DevOps Practices:

## Students Comments - What are your expectations of the course?

### Student SoftServe Jose Alcaraz
DevOps is currently a very important methodology for companies due to the benefits in the software development flow that it provides. I am very excited to learn about DevOps and acquire knowledge from people who have a lot of experience working with this topic.

## How the git merge conflict was fixed by [Jose Alcaraz](https://github.com/JoseAlcarazA "Jose Alcaraz")
A git merge conflict, like the one presented in this case, is due to two developers modifying the same lines in a file, the first developer merges his changes. When the second developer goes to update his branch with the latest changes from the repository conflict is generated.
To solve it, git provides help indicating which is the file that presents the conflict

*Example:*
>`Auto-merging README.md` <br>
`CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md` <br>
`Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result` <br>

Also, inside the file, it shows which lines have the problem.

*Example:*
>`<<<<<<< HEAD` <br>
`(Current Change)` <br>
`=======` <br>
`(Incoming Change)` <br>
`>>>>>>>`

You must choose the content between **"<<<<<<< HEAD y ======="** (Local branch changes) and **"======= y >>>>>>"** content present in the remote main branch.
After choosing what information should be left in the file, changes must be saved.
Now, you can add the changes and make a commit. Once this is done, the conflict will be resolved, and you can make the pull request to the main branch without any problem.

*Commands:*
>`git add .` <br>
`git commit -m "message"` <br>
`git push origin branch` <br>
